# case_study

The case study was devided into two main parts:
1. Input_data.ipynb.
2. Case_study_app.py

In the first script the source was read, transformed to dataframe and manipulated to acheive the best quality. Output from this procedure is stored as sales_NY.json and airbnb_NY.json. Basing on these two .json files the Case_study_app.py was run executing several functions and resulting in the Streamlit dashbord that can be found on the page: https://casestudy-drj4kvlwuew.streamlit.app/
To see the results it is not necesarry to run all codes, but to visit the Streamlit app from the link.
